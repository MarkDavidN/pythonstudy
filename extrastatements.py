#1.Assume start_date = '2024-01-01' and end_date = '2024-12-31'. Write a conditional statement that checks:
#If start_date comes before end_date, print "Valid period",
#If start_date is after end_date, print "Invalid period".
#If both dates are the same, print "One-day period".


#2.Given two strings str1 and str2, write a conditional statement that checks:
#If str1 is longer than str2, print "str1 is longer".
#If str2 is longer than str1, print "str2 is longer".
#If both have equal length, print "Both are of equal length".
#3.Given a list valid_ids = [101, 102, 103] and a variable user_id = 105, write a conditional statement that:
#Prints "Access Granted" if user_id is in valid_ids.
#Prints "Access Denied" if user_id is not in valid_ids.
#4.Given a variable value that could be of any type, write a conditional statement that:
#Prints "String Detected" if value is a string.
#Prints "Integer Detected" if value is an integer.
#Prints "Unknown Type" for any other type.
#5.Given x = 7 and y = 14, write nested conditional statements that print:
#"x and y are both even" if both x and y are even numbers.
#"Only y is even" if only y is even.
#"Neither x nor y are even" if both are odd.
